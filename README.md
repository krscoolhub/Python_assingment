Q1. Why do we call Python as a general purpose and high-level programming language?
ANS:
# It provides rich data types and easier to read syntax than any other programming languages. 
# It is a platform independent scripted language with full access to operating system API's.
# Compared to other programming languages, it allows more run-time flexibility.
# For building large applications, Python can be compiled to byte-code.
# Python supports functional and structured programming as well as OOP.
# In Python, since there is no compilation step, editing, debugging and testing is fast.
# Easy-to-learn − Python has few keywords, simple structure, and a clearly defined syntax. This allows the student to pick up the language quickly.
# Easy-to-read − Python code is more clearly defined and visible to the eyes.
# Easy-to-maintain − Python's source code is fairly easy-to-maintain.
# A broad standard library − Python's bulk of the library is very portable and cross-platform compatible on UNIX, Windows, and Macintosh.
# Python is a powerful language that you can use to create games, write GUIs, and develop web applications.
# It is a high-level language. Reading and writing codes in Python is much like reading and writing regular English statements. Because they are not written in machine-readable language, Python programs need to be processed before machines can run them.
# Python is an interpreted language. This means that every time a program is run, its interpreter runs through the code and translates it into machine-readable byte code.


Q2. Why is Python called a dynamically typed language?
ANS:
# Python is a dynamically typed language. It doesn’t know about the type of the variable until the code is run. So declaration is of no use. What it does is, It stores that value at some memory location and then binds that variable name to that memory container. And makes the contents of the container accessible through that variable name. So the data type does not matter. As it will get to know the type of the value at run-time.


Q3. List some pros and cons of Python programming language?
ANS:
# Pros.
Python is easy to learn and read.
Python enhances productivity.
Python has a vast collection of libraries.
Python is free, open-source, and has a vibrant community.
Python is a portable programming language.
Python is an interpreted language.
# Cons.
Slow Speed·
Not Memory Efficient.
Weak in Mobile Computing.
Database Access·
Runtime Errors.


Q4. In what all domains can we use Python?
ANS:
# Machine learning / Artificial intelligence
# Desktop GUI
# Data analytics and data visualization 
# Web development
# Game development
# Mobile app development
# Embedded systems



Q5. What are variable and how can we declare them?
ANS:
# Following variables are use in python
Integer, Long Integer, Float, and String.
# To create a string, put the sequence of characters inside either single quotes, double quotes, or triple quotes and then assign it to a variable.
eg: (ab_123)



Q6. How can we take an input from the user in Python?
ANS:
# We can use input () junction.
# input("Enter username:") print("Username is: " + username)


Q7. What is the default datatype of the value that has been taken as an input using input() function?
ANS:
# The input() function by default returns the value as string data type.


Q8. What is type casting?
ANS:
# The conversion of one data type into the other data type is known as type casting in python or type conversion in python.
# Python supports a wide variety of functions or methods like: int(), float(), str(), ord(), hex(), oct(), tuple(), set(), list(), dict(), etc. for the type casting in python.


Q9. Can we take more than one input from the user using single input() function? If yes, how? If no, why?
ANS:
# YES ,You can take multiple inputs in one single line by using the raw_input function several times as shown below.
# multiple inputs in Python using input
x, y = input("Enter First Name: "), input("Enter Last Name: ") 
print("First Name is: ", x) 
print("Second Name is: ", y)

# Output:
Enter First Name: KUMAR
Enter Last Name: SHUBHAM
First Name is: KUMAR
Second Name is: SHUBHAM


Q10. What are keywords?
ANS:
# Reserved words are present in every programming language. Be it Java or Python, each programming language has a set of reserved keywords. These words are also known as keywords. They convey a specific message.
eg:
# False               def                 if                  raise
# None                del                 import              return
# True                elif                in                  try
# and                 else                is                  while
# as                  except              lambda              with
# assert              finally             nonlocal            yield
# break               for                 not                 
# class               from                or                  
# continue            global              pass
